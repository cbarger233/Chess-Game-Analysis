# Chess-Game-Analysis
An exploratory data analysis of a dataset found on Kaggle for thousands of chess games played on Lichess. Towards the end there is a case study where I look at a possible chess cheater and compare their moves to the Stockfish 14 engine.

I plan to add more functionality in the future that will calculate users' accuracies in a game, similar to what chess.com does in their analysis of games.
